# Vuetify Dashboard

This application is a dashboard application built entirely with Vue + Vuetify. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

First, run npm install to get all the required dependencies installed

```
$ npm install
```

Next, change into the directory, and run the serve command to start the development server

```
$ cd 'your-directory-here'
$ npm run serve
```

## Deployment

All the required configuration is already present in the files for a basic deployement to Heroku.
Heroku will install dependencies, run the postinstall command (which builds the dist folder),
and then our basic express server will statically serve the built folder.

## Built With
